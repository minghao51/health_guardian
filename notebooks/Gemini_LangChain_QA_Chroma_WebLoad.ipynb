calendar years, we will process the claim within 10 working days.\\xa0 If the policy is inforce for less than 2 years or claim occurred outside of Singapore, we will review the claim within 5 working days and inform you of the status of the claim.\\n\\n\\nWhat if the claimant does not have the death certificate but the Life Assured has been missing for some time?\\n\\nThe claimant will have to get legal advice to apply for a court order that presumes the Life Assured‘s death.\\xa0 The court order is to be submitted as part of the claims document.\\n\\n\\nWhen does the claimant need to submit the Post Mortem / Toxicology Report?\\n\\nThe claims officer will advise if the Post Mortem/ Toxicology are required after assessment of the claim.\\n\\nLocal forensic authority usually perform post

submit the Coroner’s Certificate?\\n\\nThe claims officer will advise if the Coroner’s Certificate is required after assessment of the claim.\\n\\n    Generally, a coroner certificate is required for cases in which death is sudden or is suspected to be caused by unnatural means.\\n\\n\\nWhat if the claimant is unable to provide the documents needed for proof of relationship?\\n\\nThe claimant can approach the relevant local authorities for copies of the documents to be extracted at his/her expense.\\xa0 If the claimant is unable to provide the relevant documents, we reserve the right to make payment to the legal representative of the deceased’s estate upon submission of Grant of Letters of Administration or Grant of Probate and Schedule of Assets.\\n\\n\\nWho are the Proper Claimants entitled to receive the claim proceeds?\\n\\nProper Claimants are defined under Section 61 of the Insurance Act as the “widower, widow, parent, child, brother, sister, nephew or niece of the deceased.\\n\\n    Section 61 of the Insurance Act provides that the Insurer may (i.e. at its sole discretion) pay up to S$150,000 to a proper claimant without production of the Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration and Schedule of Assets.\\n\\n    The remaining amount is payable only on production of the Grant of Letters of Administration and Grant of Probate and Schedule of Assets.\\n\\n\\nWhat is Grant of Probate/Letters of Administration and Schedule of Assets and how does the estate apply for it?\\n\\nA Grant of Probate is issued by the Courts to confirm the appointment of the executor(s) named in the deceased’s will.\\n\\n    A Grant of Letters of Administration is issued by the Courts to name the legal representatives who are entitled to deal with the deceased’s estate.\\n\\n    Both can be applied through a lawyer who will draw up and submit a petition to the High Court for approval.\\xa0 It may take up to six months for the court to grant an

Such interest will be calculated using the LIA-claims interest rate from the said date of notification until the actual date of payment. Interest payable is calculated daily and compounded at the end of each calendar year.\\n\\n\\nWho do we pay if deceased had made both a nomination and a Will?\\n\\nFor Trust nomination, we will pay to the Trustee regardless of any Will.\\n\\n    For Revocable nomination, we will pay to the nominee(s) if the revocable nomination is made after the Will. \\n\\n    A valid Will executed after a Revocable Nomination has been made and made known to us will supersede the Revocable Nomination.\\xa0 However, the Will must satisfy specific requirements under the Wills Act.\\xa0 For example, the Will must provide for the disposition of all death benefits under the policy and it must specify the particulars of the relevant policy.\\n\\n\\nWhat happens if a nominee dies before the Life Assured?\\n\\nFor Trust nomination, the proceeds will be released to the deceased nominee’s estate.\\n\\n    For Revocable nomination, the deceased nominee’s share will be proportionately distributed among the surviving nominees.

Regulation 5(3) of the Insurance (NOB) Regulations 2009 lists the following particulars:\\n\\n\\nthe name of the registered insurer that issued the relevant policy\\nthe policy number\\nthe name of each beneficiary to whom any portion (including the whole) of the death benefits under the relevant policy is bequeathed\\nwhere a beneficiary referred to in sub-paragraph (c) is an individual, the following particulars of the beneficiary : NRIC/BC/Foreign passport number, address, date of birth\\nwhere a beneficiary referred to in sub-paragraph (c) is not an individual, the following particulars of the beneficiary; the Singapore unique entity number of the beneficiary or, if the beneficiary does not have such a number, any other official registration number which identifies and is unique to the entity; and the address of the beneficiary;\\nthe portion of the death benefits under the relevant policy which is bequeathed to each beneficiary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAre the proceeds protected against claims from creditors in the event of bankruptcy?\\n\\nFor policies with Trust nomination, it is protected against claims from creditors.

the Post Mortem / Toxicology Report?\\n\\nThe claims officer will advise if the Post Mortem/ Toxicology are required after assessment of the claim.\\n\\nLocal forensic authority usually perform post mortem for cases where death is sudden or unnatural.\\xa0 Toxicology test is usually done to exclude or ascertain alcohol or drug content in deceased’s blood.\\n\\n\\nWhen does the claimant need to submit the Coroner’s Certificate?\\n\\nThe claims officer will advise if the Coroner’s Certificate is required after assessment of the claim.\\n\\n    Generally, a coroner certificate is required for cases in which death is sudden or is suspected to be caused by unnatural means.\\n\\n\\nWhat if the claimant is unable to provide the documents needed for proof of relationship?\\n\\nThe claimant can approach the relevant local authorities for copies of the documents to be extracted at his/her expense.\\xa0 If the claimant is unable to provide the relevant documents, we reserve the right to make payment to the legal representative of the deceased’s estate upon submission of Grant of Letters of Administration or Grant of Probate and Schedule of Assets.\\n\\n\\nWho are the Proper Claimants entitled to receive the claim proceeds?\\n\\nProper Claimants are defined under Section 61 of the Insurance Act as the “widower, widow, parent, child, brother, sister, nephew or niece of the deceased.\\n\\n    Section 61 of the Insurance Act provides that the Insurer may (i.e. at its sole discretion) pay up to S$150,000 to a proper claimant without production of the Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration and Schedule of Assets.\\n\\n    The remaining amount is payable only on production of the Grant of Letters of Administration and Grant of Probate and Schedule of Assets.\\n\\n\\nWhat is Grant of Probate/Letters of Administration and Schedule of Assets and how does the estate apply for it?\\n\\nA Grant of Probate is issued by the Courts to confirm the appointment of the executor(s) named in the deceased’s will.\\n\\n    A Grant of Letters of Administration is issued by the Courts to name the legal representatives who are entitled to deal with the deceased’s estate.\\n\\n    Both can be applied through a lawyer who will draw up and submit a petition to the High Court for approval.\\xa0 It may take up to six months for the court to grant an approval, depending on the complexities of the deceased’s estate.\\n\\n    Please note that the Grant of Probate/ Letters of Administration will have to be applied in Singapore. \\n    \\n \\n    The Schedule of Assets will also be included as part of the Grant of Letters of Administration and Grant of Probate.\\n    \\n\\nDo we accept Probate or Letters of Administration issued by the authorities outside of Singapore?\\n\\nThe Probate or Letters of Administration must be applied and issued by Singapore Court.\\n\\n    If the country issuing the Probate or Letters of Administration is a member of the Commonwealth Country, the Probate or Letters of Administration must be resealed in Singapore. The claimant can engage a Singapore lawyer to assist them on the reseal process.\\n\\n\\nIs interest payable on the death claim in view that the extraction of the Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration takes a few months?\\n\\nUnder the Life Insurance Association Singapore (LIA) statement of life insurance practice, interest is payable when the payment of a claim is made more than two months from the date of receipt of written notification of the death. Such interest will be calculated using the LIA-claims interest rate from the said date of notification until the actual date of payment. Interest payable is calculated daily and compounded at the end of each calendar year.\\n\\n\\nWho do we pay if deceased had made both a nomination and a Will?\\n\\nFor Trust nomination, we will pay to the Trustee regardless of any Will.\\n\\n    For Revocable nomination, we will pay to the nominee(s) if the revocable nomination is made after the Will. \\n\\n    A valid Will executed after a Revocable Nomination has been made and made known to us will supersede the Revocable Nomination.\\xa0 However, the Will must satisfy specific requirements under the Wills Act.\\xa0 For example, the Will must provide for the disposition of all death benefits under the policy and it must specify the particulars of the relevant policy.\\n\\n\\nWhat happens if a nominee dies before the Life Assured?\\n\\nFor Trust nomination, the proceeds will be released to the deceased nominee’s estate.\\n\\n    For Revocable nomination, the deceased nominee’s share will be proportionately distributed among the surviving nominees. If there are no other nominees, the nomination will be deemed as revoked and it will be paid to the legal representative of the deceased’s estate.\\n\\n\\nWhat are the exact requirements necessary for a Will to be able to supersede an earlier Revocable Nomination made under Section 49M (2) of the Insurance Act?\\n\\nThe Will must be made in accordance with the Wills Act (Cap.352) which provides for the disposition of all death benefits under the relevant policy; and specifies the particulars of that relevant policy referred to in regulation 5(3) of the Insurance (NOB) Regulations 2009. Regulation 5(3) of the Insurance (NOB) Regulations 2009 lists the following particulars:\\n\\n\\nthe name of the registered insurer that issued the relevant policy\\nthe policy number\\nthe name of each beneficiary to whom any portion (including the whole) of the death benefits under the relevant policy is bequeathed\\nwhere a beneficiary referred to in sub-paragraph (c) is an individual, the following particulars of the beneficiary : NRIC/BC/Foreign passport number, address, date of birth\\nwhere a beneficiary referred to in sub-paragraph (c) is not an individual, the following particulars of the beneficiary; the Singapore unique entity number of the beneficiary or, if the beneficiary does not have such a number, any other official registration number which identifies and is unique to the entity; and the address of the beneficiary;\\nthe portion of the death benefits under the relevant policy which is bequeathed to each beneficiary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAre the proceeds protected against claims from creditors in the event of bankruptcy?\\n\\nFor policies with Trust nomination, it is protected against claims from creditors. However, this will not apply if it is proved that the relevant policy was effected with the intent to defraud creditors.\\n\\n    For Revocable nomination, it is not protected against claims from creditors.\\n\\n\\nIf there is a nomination under the policy and the nominee is still a minor at the time of death of the Life Assured, who do we pay to?\\n\\nFor Trust Nomination, we will pay the claim proceeds to the Trustee who will administer the monies for the benefit of the nominee(s).\\n\\n    For Revocable Nomination, if the child is of at least 18 years of age, the death claim will be paid directly to the nominee. If the child is below 18 years of age, the death claim will be payable to the legal guardian for the benefit of the nominee.\\n\\n\\nIf the policyowner had predeceased the Life Assured, who do we pay the claim proceeds to in the event of death of the Life Assured?\\n\\nUpon the death of the policyowner, the policy is vested under the Estate of the policyowner. The Grant of Probate (if there is a Will) or Grant of Letters of Administration (if there is no Will) and Schedule of Assets of the policyowner will be required for the claim to be paid to the Executor or Administrator to administer the claim monies for the benefit of the deceased policyowner’s estate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerminal Illness Claim\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerminal Illness Claim\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.

So he is ready to do and risk almost everything for his research (even his own life, although he probably doesn\\'t view that as much of a risk at that point), but unlike Singed he still draws a line when it comes to harming others. And I think that is a pretty fundamental part of his character and the kind of scientist he is and it\\'s also why he\\'s so outright horrified and vehemently against it when Mel and Jayce consider creating weapons.',\n",

Nice catch, Georgia.\\n\\nGreat analysis of Singed's conversation and friendship with Viktor (and haha I have trouble pronouncing Singed's name too). I can see how he projects his thoughts onto Viktor - and agree that they definitely relate to each other through their shared backgrounds as inventors/scientists and loneliness. One of the things that I love about the show is their effective use of showing vs. telling and how they can show character relationships effectively and powerfully (like Viktor and Singe's relationship) without heavy exposition. \\n\\nExcellent point about humanitarian vs. scientist/greater good debate.

The moment his research actually harms another person (aka kills Sky) and not just himself he immediately decides to put an end to it, even if that means giving up any hope for his own life. So he is ready to do and risk almost everything for his research (even his own life, although he probably doesn\\'t view that as much of a risk at that point), but unlike Singed he still draws a line when it comes to harming others.

Nice catch, Georgia.\\n\\nGreat analysis of Singed's conversation and friendship with Viktor (and haha I have trouble pronouncing Singed's name too). I can see how he projects his thoughts onto Viktor - and agree that they definitely relate to each other through their shared backgrounds as inventors/scientists and loneliness. One of the things that I love about the show is their effective use of showing vs. telling and how they can show character relationships effectively and powerfully (like Viktor and Singe's relationship) without heavy exposition. \\n\\nExcellent point about humanitarian vs. scientist/greater good debate. It's a debate that I've seen with so many issues and I like how the show addressed it in a very nuanced way.\\n\\nI hope you make a video about adult Viktor one day too :).

water but they're happy\\nand they're all together and here he is\\nwith this beautiful fanciful contraption\\nthat we can tell that he's made himself\\nand i love his eyes he's seen someone\\nanother friend that's come over to take\\na a look at what he's made and you can\\nsee his eyebrows goes up he's quizzical\\nhe's hoping to make a connection isn't\\nthat what we all want we want to be able\\nto make connections with others and when\\nwe're young that's really important to\\nus we're trying to form peer groups\\nbecause that makes us feel like we're\\npart of a tribe which we really need to\\nbe able to feel a sense of identity\\n[Music]\\nand how heartbreaking you can tell that\\nhe's so excited to show this little girl\\nthis cool contraption and he's hoping\\nthat this contraption will kind of\\ncaptivate so he shows her how it moves\\nbut she gets called away to her friends\\nand she's on this rock formation that he\\ncan't get to\\nbecause of his own difficulty with\\nwalking he can't climb and so i think\\nthat this really shows this\\njuxtaposition of why he is so separated\\nfrom the other kids because they're\\nclimbing on these rocks and jumping in\\nthis water and he's not able to and so\\nwe leave with this scene of him being\\nsocially isolated from others and what\\nhappens to us when at a young age we\\nfeel isolated from others we feel like\\nwe don't fit in we're that black sheep\\nwe're different\\nit can be something that causes a social\\nanxiety where we decide you know what\\ni'm gonna try to isolate myself but i'm\\ngonna try to get involved but it's gonna\\nfeel awkward and uncomfortable social\\nanxiety is that fear of judgment from\\nothers\\nor we might decide that you know what\\ni'm gonna learn to depend on myself\\nentertain myself become my own best\\nfriend i'm gonna try to find another way\\nto make me make a difference and become\\nmy own best friend and those two\\ndecisions kind of happen depending on\\nour personality type and the things that\\nare around us and our talents and skills\\nthat we have at the moment\\n[Applause]\\n[Music]\\ni love the little giggle that victor has\\nbecause you can tell that that's the\\nchoice that he made he's proud of his\\nown little tiny contraption there's\\nsomething that happened inside of his\\nhead this little dialogue of wow that\\nwas pretty cool i think that this this\\nentertained me quite a good deal and we\\nhave to say that the boat is pretty\\nawesome so i completely get why he is\\nplum pleased with himself\\n[Music]\\ni think it's also very telling that he\\ncreated something that can travel and\\ntravel so effortlessly much better than\\nhe can with his own legs after he falls\\nand trips he has created something\\nthat's an extension of him that can\\ntravel and travel really quickly and i\\nthink that that kind of gives us some\\nforeshadowing of what he hopes to be\\nable to create later in life\\n[Music]\\nthough he has difficulty in walking you\\nsee this scene where he has all these\\nboulders and rocks that are in his way\\nand it shows his resilience because\\nthough you can tell that this is going\\nto be very difficult for him to be able\\nto walk through\\nhe makes it anyways he's learnt\\ndetermination he's learned that he's not\\ngoing to let things stop him even if it\\ntakes longer to be able to get there\\nhe's going to get the job done don't be\\nafraid\\nyou built this\\nwhy aren't you playing with the others i\\nlove that singed holds up the boat and\\nright away goes you built this he's\\nshowing interest in victor's creation\\nthen also asking him a very personal\\nquestion why aren't you playing with the\\nothers\\nand victor comes out and shows that he\\nwalks with a cane as though that is the\\nanswer for it but i love sinch\\nsinch\\ni love since\\ni love sinja's reply\\nloneliness is often the byproduct of a\\ngifted mind\\nperfect loneliness is often the\\nbyproduct of a gifted mind he doesn't\\nsee the fact that he has a leg that\\ndoesn't work very well is the reason for\\nit he's saying you're intelligent and\\nbecause of that you are wanting to make\\nand create things and maybe you see\\nyourself as different than the other\\nkids and sometimes that that can cause\\nloneliness i believe that for singed\\nhe's talking about himself he's actually\\nprojecting his own thoughts onto victor\\nbecause\\nhe himself is a gifted mind and\\nusually when you see singed he's almost\\nalways alone what is it this\\nis real here's a rare mutation that i\\ncultivated so now victor is showing\\ninterest in sinja's creation singed and\\nthat's really cool because here are two\\ninventors\\nscientists that are taking a look at\\nwhat no one else really gets to see or\\nfully appreciate\\n[Music]\\nokay and i'll just say i love rio rio is\\nmy favorite creature in the entire show\\njust so cute the little tiny trilling\\nlike right away with those big beautiful\\neyes and the cute little noises it plays\\non our heartstrings we're meant to want\\nto love and have affection towards rio i\\nthink that they do a great job\\nespecially with victor laughing and\\ngiggling as victor gives rio a gift of\\nfood rio gives back a gift of slime as\\nif making a fair trade but just so very\\ncute she's dying\\ni'm attempting to prevent that the\\nmutation must survive can i help you\\nwant to assist me\\nvery well wow so that ability like that\\nasking to be able to be a part of\\nsomething it takes so much ego strength\\nto be able to ask that fear of rejection\\nof abandonment of not being good enough\\nof being annoying or having someone say\\nyes out of pity is so terrifying for so\\nmany of us and when sinch looks over and\\nasks him again you want to help i love\\nvictor's little tiny shrug like yeah\\nkind of\\nwould you let me do that and you can see\\nhis eyebrows furrow of he's worried\\nabout the reply is he going to be good\\nenough and be accepted also he wants to\\nbe able to help if he can make a\\ndifference in order to keep her alive he\\nwants to and that shows who he is as a\\nperson he wants to be able to make a\\ndifference in people's lives he wants to\\nbe able to do good\\nmake a mark\\ncount\\nmatter very well\\nwe can be loners together\\ni loved sanji's reply singed i love\\nsinged\\nis i love singe's reply\\nwe can be lonely together one is because\\nit's so heartfelt he touches his\\nshoulder really softly if they're\\ntogether then they're not actually\\nlonely so here we have two people that\\nare like-minded i think that singed sees\\na lot of himself in victor now he's\\nfound a kindred spirit that he can\\nmentor and be able to teach and\\nwatch and grow\\ni love this it shows victor's heart how\\ndeep it is and gives it this heartfelt\\nhug that they're in distress there's\\nsomething wrong with them\\nrio\\nwill live\\nyou did this\\ni thought you understood the mutation\\nmust survive\\nvictor no doubt was hoping for it to be\\nhappy and its well-being was taken care\\nof and for singed it was important as\\nthe experiment to keep the mutation\\nalive so that he could end up finding\\nout and learning from it those two\\npieces of humanitarian versus scientist\\nand\\nis the greater good worth even if\\nsomething is created in pain it's a\\nquestion that philosophers and\\nscientists ask all the time and we see\\nthose two pieces in victor and in\\nmutation must survive\\nand then when cinge reached down i was\\nexpecting him to cuddle rio or touch rio\\ncomfort them but the thing that he did\\nwas he made sure that all of the tubes\\nwere hooked up correctly and so it also\\nshows that for singed it's first and\\nforemost that he makes sure that the\\nexperiment is successful because that is\\nso important to him\\ni understand now\\nand when victor comes back as an adult\\nit's only at this very moment when\\nvictor's own life when it might be his\\nown experiment that might be destroyed\\nand ruined that he gets wise singed put\\nso much emphasis on keeping rio alive\\neven though it may not have been the\\nbest thing for rio it sounds like he's\\nsaying sorry when he's using those words\\nfor lee singh sometimes the ends justify\\nthe means and it seems like victor has\\ncome back saying yes i think that this\\nis really important as well and i\\nunderstand and i'm sorry that i didn't\\nunderstand when i was young\\nand it's so sad you see rio in the tank\\nand doesn't really look like rio is\\nalive it seems like rio's being kept in\\nthis suspended animation and it's kind\\nof heartfelt and heartbreaking you see\\nsinged looking at him with this soft\\nlook in that blink as though he's\\naccepting that victor has come back and\\nthat at least finally he understands a\\nlittle bit about what singed is hoping\\nto do and i believe that for victor\\nit's a huge difference in the way that\\nheimerdinger does things and singed does\\nthings he has come full circle and he's\\ngoing back to singed with knowing that\\nsometimes when your experiment the thing\\nthat you've put so much energy into that\\nwhen that has a risk of being destroyed\\nor lost you might choose to do the wrong\\nthing in order to keep it alive after\\nheimerdinger said that you know what you\\nhave to destroy your experiment he went\\nback to sinj because he knows that singh\\nwould understand that sometimes he's\\ngoing to do whatever he has to to keep\\nhis experiment alive because he truly\\nbelieves that this can help people and\\nhelp himself but also when you've worked\\non creating something and put all your\\nenergy into it and you want to make a\\ndifference when you felt like your life\\ndidn't matter that that want to make a\\nmark on the world is so great and for\\nvictor\\nhis life is at stake but also his legacy\\nhe now really understands why singed\\nwould do\\nalmost anything to be able to keep his\\nexperiment there so victor was a pretty\\namazing scientist and if you want to\\nlearn a little bit more about creating\\nyour own amazing things you can

              "[Document(page_content=\", global leaders will gather in Dubai to build momentum for climate action. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts that the world needs to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030. We believe that artificial intelligence (AI) and collective action can help achieve this goal and create a sustainable future for everyone.Today, we released a report with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which shows that AI has the potential to help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 — the equivalent of the total annual emissions of the European Union. Here’s a look at how we’re building AI that can drive climate progress, while at the same time working to mitigate AI’s environmental impact.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccelerating climate action with AIAI can have a transformative effect on climate progress. Already, it is starting to address climate challenges in three key areas: providing people and organizations with better information to make more sustainable choices, delivering improved predictions to help adapt to climate change, and finding recommendations to optimize climate action for high-impact applications.Here’s a look at how, at Google, we’ve used AI to address climate challenges:Providing helpful information: People are looking for information to reduce their environmental footprint. Fuel-efficient routing in Google Maps uses AI to suggest routes that have fewer hills, less traffic, and constant speeds with the same or similar ETA. Since launching in October 2021, fuel-efficient routing is estimated to have helped prevent more than 2.4 million metric tons of CO2e emissions — the equivalent of taking approximately 500,000 fuel-based cars off the road for a year.1Predicting climate-related events: Floods are the most common natural disaster, causing thousands of fatalities and\\u2009disrupting the lives of millions every year. Since 2018, Google Research has been working on our flood forecasting initiative, which uses advanced AI and geospatial analysis to provide real-time flooding information so communities and individuals can prepare for and respond to riverine floods. Our Flood Hub platform is available to more than 80 countries, providing forecasts up to seven days in advance for 460 million people.Optimizing climate action: Contrails — the thin, white lines you sometimes see behind airplanes — have a surprisingly large impact on our climate. The 2022 IPCC report noted that contrail clouds account for roughly 35% of aviation's global warming impact — which is over half the impact of the world’s jet fuel. Google Research teamed up with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to bring together huge amounts of data — like satellite imagery, weather and flight path data — and used AI to develop contrail forecast maps to test if pilots can choose routes that avoid creating contrails. After these test flights, we found that the pilots reduced contrails by 54%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging the environmental impact of AIWhile scaling these applications of AI and finding new ways to use it to accelerate climate action is crucial, we need to build AI responsibly and manage the environmental impact associated with it.As AI is at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. Historically, data center energy consumption has grown much more slowly than demand for computing power. In 2022, global data center electricity consumption accounted for 1-1.3% of global final electricity demand.Making AI computing more efficient requires using proven methods to cut emissions, while also uncovering new ways to increase efficiency. To minimize the carbon footprint of AI workloads, we rely on tested practices that can reduce the energy required to train an AI model by up to 100 times and reduce associated emissions by up to 1,000 times. To support the next generation of AI advances, our Tensor Processing Units v4 is proven to be one of the fastest, most efficient and most sustainable ML infrastructure hubs in the world. Additionally, our data centers, where this AI computing takes place, are designed, built, and operated to maximize efficiency. A Google-owned and -operated data center is on average more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center, and the average annual power usage effectiveness (PUE) for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55.We take a climate-conscious approach to cooling our data centers, as we continue to champion responsible water use. Similar to a personal computer, data centers generate heat and must be cooled through air cooling, water cooling, refrigerants or some combination of these solutions. For our data centers, we aim to support hyperlocal factors and decisions, including hydrology, geography, energy and emissions factors. Water may be the most efficient means of cooling in many places and, when used responsibly, can play an important role in reducing emissions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorking together to drive positive climate impactsCreating a sustainable future requires collective action from policymakers, government officials, city planners, business leaders and individuals. Policymakers, in particular, have a central role to play both in harnessing the potential of AI for climate action and in ensuring its sustainable and equitable use. Policymakers can make a difference in accelerating three outcomes:Enabling AI for climate progress by encouraging data sharing, ensuring affordable technology access, building awareness, and supporting the creation and expansion of AI and climate-related upskilling programs for corporations.Accelerating the deployment of AI for climate by defining public and private sector priorities, delivering on public sector use cases, and encouraging private sector action.Promoting environmentally and socially responsible deployment of AI.Together, we can boldly and responsibly develop more tools and products that harness the power of AI to accelerate the climate progress we need.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'local'})]"

              "[Document(page_content=\", global leaders will gather in Dubai to build momentum for climate action. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts that the world needs to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030. We believe that artificial intelligence (AI) and collective action can help achieve this goal and create a sustainable future for everyone.Today, we released a report with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which shows that AI has the potential to help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 — the equivalent of the total annual emissions of the European Union. Here’s a look at how we’re building AI that can drive climate progress, while at the same time working to mitigate AI’s environmental impact.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccelerating climate action with AIAI can have a transformative effect on climate progress. Already, it is starting to address climate challenges in three key areas: providing people and organizations with better information to make more sustainable choices, delivering improved predictions to help adapt to climate change, and finding recommendations to optimize climate action for high-impact applications.Here’s a look at how, at Google, we’ve used AI to address climate challenges:Providing helpful information: People are looking for information to reduce their environmental footprint. Fuel-efficient routing in Google Maps uses AI to suggest routes that have fewer hills, less traffic, and constant speeds with the same or similar ETA. Since launching in October 2021, fuel-efficient routing is estimated to have helped prevent more than 2.4 million metric tons of CO2e emissions — the equivalent of taking approximately 500,000 fuel-based cars off the road for a year.1Predicting climate-related events: Floods are the most common natural disaster, causing thousands of fatalities and\\u2009disrupting the lives of millions every year. Since 2018, Google Research has been working on our flood forecasting initiative, which uses advanced AI and geospatial analysis to provide real-time flooding information so communities and individuals can prepare for and respond to riverine floods. Our Flood Hub platform is available to more than 80 countries, providing forecasts up to seven days in advance for 460 million people.Optimizing climate action: Contrails — the thin, white lines you sometimes see behind airplanes — have a surprisingly large impact on our climate. The 2022 IPCC report noted that contrail clouds account for roughly 35% of aviation's global warming impact — which is over half the impact of the world’s jet fuel. Google Research teamed up with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to bring together huge amounts of data — like satellite imagery, weather and flight path data — and used AI to develop contrail forecast maps to test if pilots can choose routes that avoid creating contrails. After these test flights, we found that the pilots reduced contrails by 54%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging the environmental impact of AIWhile scaling these applications of AI and finding new ways to use it to accelerate climate action is crucial, we need to build AI responsibly and manage the environmental impact associated with it.As AI is at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. Historically, data center energy consumption has grown much more slowly than demand for computing power. In 2022, global data center electricity consumption accounted for 1-1.3% of global final electricity demand.Making AI computing more efficient requires using proven methods to cut emissions, while also uncovering new ways to increase efficiency. To minimize the carbon footprint of AI workloads, we rely on tested practices that can reduce the energy required to train an AI model by up to 100 times and reduce associated emissions by up to 1,000 times. To support the next generation of AI advances, our Tensor Processing Units v4 is proven to be one of the fastest, most efficient and most sustainable ML infrastructure hubs in the world. Additionally, our data centers, where this AI computing takes place, are designed, built, and operated to maximize efficiency. A Google-owned and -operated data center is on average more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center, and the average annual power usage effectiveness (PUE) for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55.We take a climate-conscious approach to cooling our data centers, as we continue to champion responsible water use. Similar to a personal computer, data centers generate heat and must be cooled through air cooling, water cooling, refrigerants or some combination of these solutions. For our data centers, we aim to support hyperlocal factors and decisions, including hydrology, geography, energy and emissions factors. Water may be the most efficient means of cooling in many places and, when used responsibly, can play an important role in reducing emissions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorking together to drive positive climate impactsCreating a sustainable future requires collective action from policymakers, government officials, city planners, business leaders and individuals. Policymakers, in particular, have a central role to play both in harnessing the potential of AI for climate action and in ensuring its sustainable and equitable use. Policymakers can make a difference in accelerating three outcomes:Enabling AI for climate progress by encouraging data sharing, ensuring affordable technology access, building awareness, and supporting the creation and expansion of AI and climate-related upskilling programs for corporations.Accelerating the deployment of AI for climate by defining public and private sector priorities, delivering on public sector use cases, and encouraging private sector action.Promoting environmentally and socially responsible deployment of AI.Together, we can boldly and responsibly develop more tools and products that harness the power of AI to accelerate the climate progress we need.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'local'})]"
