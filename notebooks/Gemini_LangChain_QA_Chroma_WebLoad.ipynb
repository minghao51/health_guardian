I was lucky \\nto receive help from both my husband and the “SMS-lifesavers” \\nwho came fast. After almost 24 hours in a coma, where my \\nfamily didn’t know if I would live or die, I woke up. \\nMy world became very different from the one I knew before. \\nI was incredibly tired, both physically and mentally. I experi-\\nenced enormous brain fatigue, difficulties with memory and \\nconcentration, sensitivity to sound, and great sadness. My chil-\\ndren, husband and relatives all had to adapt to my limitations, \\nand I had to learn to cope with the new me. \\nThree years have passed and I feel much better. It’s been \\na challenge to deal with my difficulties and learning new \\nstrategies for getting through the day. Now, I live a very good \\nlife where I’ve accepted the changes, and adaptations are an \\nimportant part of making daily life work for me. ”Karin, loved one: \\n“The unthinkable thing that just couldn’t happen, happened. \\nOur daughter had a sudden cardiac arrest one morning at \\nhome. Thereafter followed a day where we, her parents, hus-\\nband, and siblings found ourselves in a bubble, in a complete \\nvacuum, in a tiny room for relatives at the intensive care ward. \\nWe lived in complete uncertainty whether she would live or \\nif she would have serious brain damage from the 15 minutes of \\nlack of oxygen during the heart attack. The hospital staff were \\nwonderful and tried to support us in every way. \\nBut there were questions they just couldn’t answer. It was a \\nmagical moment when she woke out of her coma, looked at us \\nand said, “Where am I?

              " Document(page_content='10 \\nLIFE AFTER CARDIAC ARREST Information for survivors and their loved onesVarious professions and competencies are involved in fol-\\nlow-up and rehabilitation after cardiac arrest. Representa-\\ntives from cardiology, ICU, neurology, and physiotherapy \\nare often engaged in care. Other professionals such as \\noccupational therapists, neuropsychologists or counselors \\nare involved as needed. This can look different depending \\non where you are in the country, but it is important that \\nlocal contacts are established and collaborations in the \\nfollow up are built. \\nAll patients should be offered a return visit to the \\nhospital within 1-3 months after discharge. Such fol-\\nlow-ups usually takes place at a cardiac clinic and/or post \\nICU-clinic. Follow-up of children and their relatives should \\ninitially be organized by a specialist. \\nSwedish CPR Council guidelines state that a structured \\nfollow-up should be held to confirm that the patients and \\nrelatives have received sufficient information on the cause \\nof cardiac arrest, the course of events, sick leave, driving, \\netc. \\nFurthermore, an examination is done of any remaining \\ndifficulties related to the cardiac arrest, such as physical \\nfatigue, brain fatigue, pain, physical limitations, cognitive \\n(mental) or emotional difficulties. If the need for extra support measures is identified, the follow-up should lead \\nto a plan for further investigation and possible rehabilita-\\ntion. Cooperation with primary care is important as much \\nof the support is likely to take place there.\\nThose who have received an ICD/pacemaker are regularly \\ncalled to the hospital’s cardiac clinic for check-ups.\\nThe guidelines can be read on the Swedish CPR Coun-\\ncil’s website hlr.nu. \\nwww.hlr.nu/vard-efter-hjartstopp/\\nThe rehabilitation plan depends largely on the cause of \\nthe cardiac arrest and the possible consequences caused \\nby the event. Since myocardial infarctions and other heart \\ndiseases cause most cardiac arrests, an important part \\nof post-care is to reduce the risk of developing new heart \\nproblems, so-called secondary prevention. It can consist \\nof, for example, drugs that lower blood pressure and blood \\nfats, help to quit smoking, physical activity, and stress \\nmanagement. Some cardiac arrest survivors are offered to \\ntrain in special “heart groups” with the support of a phys-\\niotherapist for a period of time. Many hospitals also offer \\n“cardiac schools”, which are a series of lectures in which \\ndifferent professional groups participate.\\nIn the case that cognitive abilities are affected, for \\nexample, if there are effects on memory, concentration, or \\nability to plan, continued assessment by an occupational \\ntherapist or neuropsychologist may be warranted. It is im-\\nportant to try to understand where these difficulties arise \\nfrom. Part of the problem can be related to brain damage \\nthat occurred during the cardiac arrest, but it can also \\ndepend on other factors such as physical exhaustion, brain \\nfatigue, poor sleep, or emotional difficulties. \\nDifferent strategies and aids can make daily life easier. \\nThese can include different types of memory support \\ndevices such as alarms, calendars or to-do lists, but they \\ncan also involve adapting to daily life and doing things \\ndifferently. For the few survivors who have suffered severe \\nbrain damage, care and support at a specialized rehabilita-\\ntion unit and/or cognitive medical unit may be required.\\nBecause emotional reactions are not uncommon, it \\nis appropriate to offer both patients and loved ones the \\nsupport of a counselor or psychologist who can assess the \\nneed for additional support.

Representa-\\ntives from cardiology, ICU, neurology, and physiotherapy \\nare often engaged in care. Other professionals such as \\noccupational therapists, neuropsychologists or counselors \\nare involved as needed. This can look different depending \\non where you are in the country, but it is important that \\nlocal contacts are established and collaborations in the \\nfollow up are built. \\nAll patients should be offered a return visit to the \\nhospital within 1-3 months after discharge. Such fol-\\nlow-ups usually takes place at a cardiac clinic and/or post \\nICU-clinic. Follow-up of children and their relatives should \\ninitially be organized by a specialist. \\nSwedish CPR Council guidelines state that a structured \\nfollow-up should be held to confirm that the patients and \\nrelatives have received sufficient information on the cause \\nof cardiac arrest, the course of events, sick leave, driving, \\netc. \\nFurthermore, an examination is done of any remaining \\ndifficulties related to the cardiac arrest, such as physical \\nfatigue, brain fatigue, pain, physical limitations, cognitive \\n(mental) or emotional difficulties. If the need for extra support measures is identified, the follow-up should lead \\nto a plan for further investigation and possible rehabilita-\\ntion. Cooperation with primary care is important as much \\nof the support is likely to take place there.\\nThose who have received an ICD/pacemaker are regularly \\ncalled to the hospital’s cardiac clinic for check-ups.\\nThe guidelines can be read on the Swedish CPR Coun-\\ncil’s website hlr.nu. \\nwww.hlr.nu/vard-efter-hjartstopp/\\nThe rehabilitation plan depends largely on the cause of \\nthe cardiac arrest and the possible consequences caused \\nby the event. Since myocardial infarctions and other heart \\ndiseases cause most cardiac arrests, an important part \\nof post-care is to reduce the risk of developing new heart \\nproblems, so-called secondary prevention. It can consist \\nof, for example, drugs that lower blood pressure and blood \\nfats, help to quit smoking, physical activity, and stress \\nmanagement. Some cardiac arrest survivors are offered to \\ntrain in special “heart groups” with the support of a phys-\\niotherapist for a period of time. Many hospitals also offer \\n“cardiac schools”, which are a series of lectures in which \\ndifferent professional groups participate.\\nIn the case that cognitive abilities are affected, for \\nexample, if there are effects on memory, concentration, or \\nability to plan, continued assessment by an occupational \\ntherapist or neuropsychologist may be warranted. It is im-\\nportant to try to understand where these difficulties arise \\nfrom. Part of the problem can be related to brain damage \\nthat occurred during the cardiac arrest, but it can also \\ndepend on other factors such as physical exhaustion, brain \\nfatigue, poor sleep, or emotional difficulties. \\nDifferent strategies and aids can make daily life easier. \\nThese can include different types of memory support \\ndevices such as alarms, calendars or to-do lists, but they \\ncan also involve adapting to daily life and doing things \\ndifferently. For the few survivors who have suffered severe \\nbrain damage, care and support at a specialized rehabilita-\\ntion unit and/or cognitive medical unit may be required.\\nBecause emotional reactions are not uncommon, it \\nis appropriate to offer both patients and loved ones the \\nsupport of a counselor or psychologist who can assess the \\nneed for additional support.

Difficulties with memory, concentration, fatigue \\nand emotional reactions are relatively common, espe-\\ncially in the beginning. Recovery times vary. The biggest \\nimprovements happen in the first couple of months but \\noften continue for a prolonged period. \\nIt is important that loved ones are involved in follow-up \\nand rehabilitation.

After \\na cardiac arrest, a shorter or extended period of uncon-\\nsciousness often follows. Therefore, post-resuscitation care \\nis most often carried out in the intensive care unit (ICU), \\nwhere advanced equipment is used to monitor the heart \\nand other important organs. A nurse or nurse’s aide is \\nalways present in the patient’s room to be able to detect \\nand remedy any complications immediately. \\nDepending on the course of events and the cause of \\nthe cardiac arrest, the care at the ICU is adapted to the \\npatient’s needs. The care includes breathing assistance \\nwith a respirator and control of body temperature to avoid \\nfever. If a heart attack (myocardial infarction - blockage in \\nthe coronary arteries of the heart) is the suspected cause \\nof the cardiac arrest, a coronary X-ray and, if necessary, \\nballoon dilation is performed. \\nThis is a difficult time for the loved ones of those who \\nhave experienced a cardiac arrest, and the uncertainty is \\ngreat, the questions are many and the answers few. During \\nthe first 24 hours after a cardiac arrest, doctors cannot \\ngive a definite prognosis. The information to loved ones \\nbecomes more detailed and the prognosis more secure as \\nthe days pass following resuscitation. There is a risk that \\nbrain damage develops due to the lack of oxygen that \\noccurs in connection with cardiac arrest. Once cardiac \\nfunction has stabilized, the extent of any brain damage is \\nthe most important factor to assess. A more well-founded \\nassessment can usually be made 3-4 days after the cardiac \\narrest, although this can take longer.\\nWhilst in the ICU, patients who show signs of waking \\ncan often go in and out of consciousness. Many become \\nincreasingly aware of time and space and eventually recog-\\nnize their loved ones. It is not certain that those who wake \\nup during the time at ICU will remember it later. Instead, \\nit is often later in the hospital’s cardiac care ward that \\nconscious awakening takes place. Some patients describe \\nthe time at the ICU as a large black hole, many have dif-\\nfuse memory images. Time spent at the ICU varies. Most \\npatients spend two to three days there, some up to several \\nweeks. A diary of the care given at the ICU and in the \\nhospital ward can help to later fill in memory gaps. Things that may have seemed insignificant may have much more \\nmeaning later in the recovery phase. The diary is written \\nby the staff at the ICU, but medical staff may also encour-\\nage loved ones to write in it. The diary may also contain \\nphotos from this time of care.\\n“I have a memory gap. Ten days are lost from my memory, but \\nfortunately, they are documented in the diary. For me, it was \\nvaluable to read the diary together with my son, who wrote a lot \\nin it.”\\n“When I look at the pictures, it becomes really clear and dis-\\ntinct. I’ve been through this. In the pictures, I have a cooling suit \\non. I immediately think that it was lucky that I was unconscious \\nthen. I’m otherwise very sensitive to cold.” \\n“When I read the diary for the first time I nearly sat and cried. \\nOne of my sons had written, ‘You were as cold as if you were al-\\nmost dead.’ He seemed to have begun to prepare himself for that.” \\nLoved ones play an important role at the hospital by being \\npresent and close by. Children are often welcome to visit \\nwhile the patient is being cared for in the ICU. Studies \\nhave shown that children can cope well when visiting \\ncritically ill loved ones.
